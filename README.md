# GATEKEEPER

Sidecar service aimed primarily for acting as an external authentication provider for Traefik's Forward-Auth middleware using JSON Web Tokens.

Slightly specialized for my own needs but most logic is generic and should be reusable. Expects a PostgreSQL backend.

Someday, I might find the time and motivation to clean this up...
